Q-Learning and Policy Iteration on the Frozen Lake Environment and Q-Learning on an Atari Game Environment

Part 1
Implement the Q-Learning algorithm 
Train Q-Learning agent on the Frozen Lake environment.
Evaluate the performance of your agent and analyze the impact of hyperparameters on the learning process. Specifically, verify the impact of the following hyperparameters:
alpha: learning rate
gamma: discount factor
epsilon: exploration rate Test at least 3 different values for each hyperparameter and explain the effect of each hyperparameter on the learning process.
Implement the policy iteration algorithm and compare its performance to Q-Learning.

Part 2
Choose an Atari game environment from the RL Gym library[1].
Adapt the Q-Learning code from Part 1 to work with the chosen Atari game environment.
Train your Q-Learning agent on the Atari game environment.
Document some quantifiable metrics to evaluate the performance of your agent. There are several performance metrics that could be used, such as the average reward per episode, the number of episodes needed to reach a certain reward threshold, etc
